				<div class="body">
					<ul>
						<li>Each period or game begins with a face-off - both chads must be present</li>
						<li>After a score, the scoring team serves the ball to their opponent</li>
						<li>You can screen or hip-check players with your side</li>
						<li>DON'T hit players with your scoop/stick, hit them harder than necessary, or hit anyone on their blind side/back</li>
						<li>DON'T throw your scoop, but you can throw the pillow</li><!-- the Kevin Smith Rule -->
						<li>DON'T intentionally kick the ball or touch it with your hands, unless you're playing goalie</li>
						<li>You can stiff arm another player's scoop but DON'T grab it</li>
						<li>If a scoop breaks, the team in possession retains the ball; otherwise, it's a face-off</li>
						<li>If the goalie picks up the ball with the scoop only, he/she can run with the ball</li>
						<li>Otherwise, the goalie must throw the ball in with the scoop and cannot leave the crease</li>
						<li>A throw in from out of bounds in the team's attacking zone must be halfway between the goal and the corner</li>
						<li>The ball is out of bounds if it is completely across the boundary or the player who has possession is completely across the boundary</li>
						<li>DON'T hold the mouth of your scoop against any part of your body to keep the ball in the scoop</li> <!-- the Sean Clymer Rule -->
