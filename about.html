				It all started back in 2004 in a little town called Troy, Ohio. Chadminton was first conceived by bored high school students who thought lacrosse looked like an interesting sport but had no access to play.
				After several prototypes and a move to Ohio State, Chadminton finally made its debut when seven college students first put pillow to scoop in 2006.
				From there, Chadminton slowly began to build momentum, gaining more and more players. By 2009, students were able to participate in a legitimate Chadminton intramural league.
				At its peak, the OSU Chadminton club had over 50 active members! Former players still get together a few times a year to relive their glory days.
				Now you can be a part of Chadminton history by helping to build a Chadminton club for young adults right here in Columbus!
