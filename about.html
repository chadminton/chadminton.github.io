					Chadminton is a sport that combines aspects of lacrosse, field hockey, and pillow fighting. Each team is equipped with scoops, which are 3-4 feet long and have a scoop-shaped basket on the end; one exception is that each team has a player called the CHAD, who brandishes a pillow and whose job it is to generally cause havoc for the opposing team in any way possible. At each end of a field is a goal, and the objective of the game is to score more points than the other team by throwing or hitting the ball into the goal.

				<div class="body">
					Chadminton was first concieved in 2004, and developed (sporadically) over a couple of years. Many different scoop designs were attempted before arriving at the equipment used today. In 2006, chadminton was brought to Ohio State, and the first game was played on May 19th, 2006. Over the next few years, chadminton would continue to grow, and eventually became an official club. From 2009 to 2013, this club hosted an intramural league with 35-50 people playing every year. Eventually, the switch to semesters proved too challenging to overcome, and the OSU club died, and with it, chadminton's recruiting pipeline.
